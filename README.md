## How to Set Up Locally

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/royg-9595/google-auth-app.git
cd <your-project-directory>
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate dependencies for the project:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scriptsctivate`
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Use `requirements.txt` to install all necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file for environment-specific settings:

```bash
touch .env
```

Add the variables from `example_env` to your `.env` file:
example:
```bash
DEBUG=True
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
EMAIL_HOST_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-email-password
```

## Step-by-Step Setup

To start the development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
